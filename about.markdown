Hi there! My name is Adam Lee, and I love machine learning and web development! I especially like deep learning and its applications to reinforcement learning and generative models. Some research interests of mine include multi-agent reinforcement learning, safe reinforcement learning, and sampling efficiency in reinforcement learning!
